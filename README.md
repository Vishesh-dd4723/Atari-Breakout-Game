In this repository, I've tried to develop a bot using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Tensorflow. The environment of the algorithm is constructed using the gym libary of OpenAI. It comprises of two versions:
<ol>
<li>RAM: It gives the environment as a features set.</li>
<li>ROM: It gives the environment as a image.</li>
</ol>

### Some of the libraries to be installed before:
<ol>
<li>gym[atari,accept-rom-license]==0.21.0</li>
<li>tensorflow-gpu</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
